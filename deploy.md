```

### 2. Railway Configuration

The following files are already configured:
- ✅ `Procfile` - Start command for Railway
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway deployment settings
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Python build configuration

### 3. Deployment Steps

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub"**
4. **Select repository**: `AbhinavG-1010/Abhinav-AI-Persona`
5. **Railway will auto-detect** Python and start building
6. **Add environment variables** (see step 1)
7. **Deploy!**

### 4. After Deployment

- ✅ **Backend API** will be available at Railway's provided URL
- ✅ **Health check** available at `/health`
- ✅ **Personal info** available at `/personal-info`
- ✅ **Chat endpoint** available at `/conversation`

### 5. Frontend Deployment (Optional)

For the React frontend, you can:
1. **Deploy to Vercel** (recommended for React)
2. **Update API URL** in frontend to point to Railway backend
3. **Deploy frontend** separately

### 6. Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Go to Railway project settings**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Build fails**: Check environment variables are set

- **Port issues**: Railway automatically sets PORT environment variable

### Logs:
- Check Railway build logs for errors
- Check Railway deploy logs for runtime issues
